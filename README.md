# Kinarm_Kagerer_Interference_Task
This task is designed for the [Kinarm Endpoint Robot](https://www.kinarm.com) and to be used with the Kinarm SDK and Dexterit-E software.  This task applies a perturbation to one hand to examine interference during bimanual reaching movements.  It is adapted from Kagerer (2015) bimanual interference joystick task.  This task also allows for synchronization with EEG to evaluate concurrent brain dynamics.
