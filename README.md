# Kinarm Kagerer Interference Task
This task was designed for the Motor Neuroscience Lab in 2016.  This task uses a [Kinarm Endpoint Robot](https://www.kinarm.com) and is meant to be used with the Kinarm SDK and Dexterit-E software.  This task applies a visuomotor perturbation to one hand to examine interference during bimanual reaching movements.  It is adapted from Kagerer (2015) bimanual interference joystick task.  This task also allows for synchronization with EEG to evaluate concurrent brain dynamics.
